# Homefinder

My first attempt at trying to use ChatGPT as an intelligent search api and failing miserably.
Onto next week's project though, gonna take the lessons learned from this(namely, never to use NextJS's beta again) and see what happens.

Watch this space ;)!

# Where host? Where can I check it out?

Unfortunately, you can't. The ChatGPT api I'm using requires a headful browser. I do not have the bank to get a server with a GUI.

# Mistakes made along the way:

- Assuming OpenAPI had a public chatgpt api and not having to use hacks.. wrong.
- Assuming NextJS beta's /app/ folder would be stable.. again, wrong.

# Lessons learned:

- If I want the experience of NextJS beta, i'll just use sveltekit instead
- If I want to use ChatGPT.. I'm gonna have to finagle a lot with the existing api wrappers and make my own(..watch this space?)
